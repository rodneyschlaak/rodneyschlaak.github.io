Brother Rod.

Life-long friend Rod.

God-father Rod.

New friend Rod.

Cousin Rod.

Rodney Edward Schlaak was born in Edmonton, Alberta on January 9, 1948 to parents Erwin and
Elnah Schlaak. He was the oldest of 3 children. His brother David arrived next and then little sister
Connie. When Rod was quite young, the Schlaak family moved to the west coast and settled near
his mother’s family in Richmond, which became home for the rest of his life.

Even from a young age Rod was kind and imaginative. Many of his school friends remained
lifelong friends. Dave Scoular gives a glimpse into those early years: “At one time Rod, Hugh and I
were like the three amigos playing with model airplanes and motorcycles. Rod was the friendly
giant at school and had one of the nicest personalities… Rodney always set the pace with his
brilliant mind and humour. He was “mister fix it” & “repair it” & “design it”. I remember him
making a hover craft out of a 5-hp. engine and, while it couldn't support his weight, it did support
a younger kid in the neighbourhood who had a blast on it … Rodney completely changed the
course of my life and I would not be the man I am today if it was not for Rodney.”

Rod was the oldest of all the cousins. Tim Schlaak remembers Rod's family’s visits to their farm
near Edmonton. On one of the family trips the station wagon was loaded down with a go cart on
top that Rod had built to show his Uncle Herb. He kept visiting over the years - often on a
motorbike with his buddies and even in a converted bread truck, a kind of “hippie mobile”.

Rod attended BCIT to take an electronic course and reportedly was their best student. They
recognized his abilities and the next year he went to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia on a scholarship. But
Rod soon figured out that working as a millwright was what he would do.

Rod worked as a special projects millwright on many big Vancouver construction projects. He
loved to solve the unsolvable problem. He joined forces with Terry at Division 10 Enterprises, and
they took on many unusual projects. They developed a niche business that ranged from seismic
bracing to computer flooring, to industrial laundry chutes and blast furnace curtains and more. To
this day many of Rod’s solutions are “standard operating procedure”.

From go carts, to model planes and steamboats, to motorcycles and refurbishing an MG car, to
creating with his CNC machine, to cooking and dabbling in virtual reality, Rod enjoyed many
hobbies. Perhaps his most notorious feat was building a 52’ long, 2 story high, sail boat in his
backyard!

Rod’s sharp mind loved humour and was ever inquisitive. We all know he was a perfectionist. The
wooden clocks, the gear filled gadgets, the humorous signs, the friendship gardens, were a
sample of the way that his mind worked. Even in the hospice the “fix-it” side of him kept working.
I think many of us found ourselves on top of chairs or re-arranging furniture or measuring
something during our visits with him. Jane, at the hospice, said that Rod “came with a chip to tell
us all how to care for him”. He never gave up trying to direct, fix and improve the world around
him.

Rod was definitely a “people person”. He had a unique way of connecting that included ribbing
and hassling a person and in no time, they were friends. He was upfront and genuine. He was a
loyal friend and it was important to him to keep in contact with those far away who were dear to
him (such as his god-daughter Shannon, and cousin Erin and their families). At the hospice where
he spent his final days, the staff were amazed by the army of friends streaming into his room
every single day.

As “younger cousins” who lived far away, we didn’t really know Rod too well growing up. We
mostly knew Rod as the cool, oldest cousin. We would be fascinated by a ride on a motorcycle,
watching his remote-controlled planes, or the sailboat taking shape in the back yard. Don (my
brother) got to know Rod better as he worked for him for several summers. Being mentored by
Rod was a highlight for Don and taught him many of the skills he uses to this day.

Rod himself would freely admit that for many years, family was not a priority for him, however
time has a way of changing those things and in these last years, family and a church community
also became precious to him.

A series of significant health events lead Rod to “deeper” thinking and wondering about life, faith,
family and priorities:
- In July of 2014 he had heart valve replacement surgery
- 6 months later, in Jan 2015 he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis
- And in December of 2018 they found cancer

These were all big blows to the very strong, independent, self-sufficient, figure-anything-out Rod.
Yet he moved through each step and diagnosis methodically, positively and determined to follow
every avenue to “beat this thing”.

In Feb of 2019, an overly friendly neighbor offered to help Rod with shoveling his snow. This
neighbor, Neil, was a bit too keen and Rod was quite leery of him. Rod tried to figure out “what
Neil’s angle was”. What did he really want?... but Neil never asked for anything, he just kept
dropping by and chatting and helping. Soon Rod met his wife, Wendy, and daughters, Anna and
Ava. Before long they found themselves at each other’s houses playing games, sharing meals,
talking about life. Anna and Ava wiggled their way into Rod’s heart (and he into theirs). Their
youthful spirits, vitality, laughs, and driveway art brought a new level of joy and life into Rod’s
days …

Anna attended a nearby preschool, and Rod made a wooden sign for them. Through this kind act
he connected with Billy & Winnie, and through them connected with North Richmond Alliance
Church.

Neil & Wendy returned to China, but the longing in Rod’s heart for something more kept growing.
This re-ignited his dormant faith-journey. Here is how Rod described what happened:
>“I don’t know when the seed was planted, but it gradually grew. My attitude started to
change slowly. I heard the Holy Spirit whispering to me. It was not a Profound
Momentous roar, it was a soft voice that in time, caused my life to completely change. I
discovered I had been wrong – that at any age, if you will only look for Jesus, He will help
and guide you and be with you always. All I needed to do was accept him into my life,
take his offer of forgiveness and make Him my LORD (instead of myself). I realized that as
much as I thought I could do my life without him, I was wrong about that too.”

I remember Rod looking for a church and trying out a couple different ones (including the one Bob
and I go to), but each church he visited just didn’t measure up to NRAC and it became clear to him
that NRAC was where he wanted to stay. After numerous delays due to Covid, Rod was baptised
on September 9, 2020.

From the moment Rodney started attending NRAC, he found a home and community he never
imagined. An Asian family who embraced “the white guy” and called him “Uncle”. Uncle Rob was
frequently touched and amazed by the love, prayers and genuineness of the NRAC family. You
embraced him and loved him, you mentored and cared for him, you prayed and supported him.
And he loved you all dearly.

A year after they had gone, Kirkland’s found themselves back in the house across the street from
Rod’s. This friendship, along with so many who dedicated themselves to his care at the end,
became a lifeline for Rod.

Rod liked to blame his medication for his emotional, “mushy” side, but I think we all know it was
his true spirit and tender heart that he just couldn’t contain.

In the early morning of September 12, this gentle giant and beloved child of God left this earth
and slipped into eternity. Many of his family were by his side and were honored to witness this
sacred event. He knew it was time, he told us so. He said his goodbyes and wanted us close. His
passing was as unique and “Rod-like” as his life.

We can’t begin to imagine what it is like for Rod now. But those of us who know the God that Sir
Rod knew, know that he is now whole, he is discovering and creating, he is reuniting with family
and friends. But most importantly, he is seeing his Lord and Saviour face to face. He is even
“more Rod” than he was here on this earth.

And as much as we miss and love him, he would not want to come back, because he is in the arms
of his Lord and Saviour. He is whole. He is fully known. He is unconditionally loved.

We miss you Sir Rod!
